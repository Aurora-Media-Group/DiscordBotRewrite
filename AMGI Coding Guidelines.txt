Okay, im going to be the boring, fun sucking, grumpy person for a minute, but I feel this is necassary to help us to keep moving forward with the bot

So here are a few guidances to follow when coding the discord bot:

G1. If someone is trouble shooting some code, leave them to edit their line of code, if you see something wrong, tell them. It can be annoying when someone starts changing your code.


G2. Please try to follow the templates. I made them to help us keep organised and keep the code clean.


G3. Remember, not everyone will understand what you are doing. Try to put a few comments on your code to explain what is happening.

  3.1. If you are leaving code unfinished, put a comment near the bottom to say so, and also say if you want to work solo or if someone else can have a go too.

  3.2. If you are having some trouble with some code, use comments to show what is happening, what should be happening, and which line (if possible) is causing the issue.


G4. Any non-fatal issues should be posted as a github issue which then we can work through and resolve at a later date.


G5. Use the Github "Project" tab to organise what needs doing!


These are NOT rules, but are very useful when trying to work efficiently as a team.
