  - View Warnings [view_warns (*user)] ["wv", "warnings", "view_warnings"]
  (allows a user to see their warnings) /manage members OR none if viewing themselves\
  {maybe a system to see if user has `manage members`, if they have then they can view anyone, if they cant then only show themselves?}

  (Sets the messages to be sent. Disable the message for that type by sending none as the value. use {} for variables like {member}, {guild})
  {Couple of things here:}
  {1. If no message type, send an embed of all the message types and their values}
  {2. If there is a message type, but no val, send the value for the message type}
  {3. If member types none as val, set the value to none, and dont send a message}
